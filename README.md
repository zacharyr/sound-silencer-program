 Sound Silencer Program
====================

<ul>
<li>Sound Silencer is a simple python program designed to silence all background noises on keystroke, so that you can peacefully talk on your microphone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making it Executable</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download and install <a title="Python" href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python</a>, <a title="PyInstaller" href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a>, and <a title="PyWin32" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/">PyWin32</a> if you have not already installed it.</li>
<li>After you downloaded and installed the previous packages, run the following command in your python terminal: <code>python pyinstaller.py -F copy_move_script.py</code>. 
<li>Running the previous command will create a single file (-F option) executable which you can place on a computer that does or even does not have python installed. This is ideal for putting the script on a flash drive so you can move directories or files on the go, involving multiple computers.</li>
</ol>
